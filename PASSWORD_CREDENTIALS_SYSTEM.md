# Password Credentials System for New User Approval

## Overview
This system automatically generates and sends login credentials to new users when their accounts are approved by administrators. It includes security features to ensure users change their temporary passwords after first login.

## How It Works

### 1. User Registration
- Users register with their own password
- Account is created with `is_approve = false` and `password_changed = false`
- Registration confirmation email is sent

### 2. Account Approval Process
When an administrator approves a user account:
- A temporary password is generated (10 random characters)
- User's password is updated with the temporary password
- `is_approve` is set to `true`
- `password_changed` is set to `false`
- Approval email with credentials is sent to the user

### 3. User Login with Temporary Password
- Users receive email with:
  - Their email address
  - Temporary password
  - Instructions to change password after first login
- Users can log in using these credentials

### 4. Password Change Requirement
- Password reminder banner appears on dashboard until password is changed
- Users must change password through Settings → Password tab
- After password change, `password_changed` is set to `true`
- Reminder banner disappears

## Files Modified/Created

### Controllers
- `app/Http/Controllers/Dashboard/HomeController.php`
  - Updated `approve()` method to generate temporary passwords
  - Added `updatePassword()` method for password changes

### Models
- `app/Models/User.php`
  - Added `password_changed` to fillable array
  - Added helper methods for password status

### Views
- `resources/views/mails/approval.blade.php`
  - Updated to include temporary password and security instructions
- `resources/views/mails/registration.blade.php`
  - Updated to inform users about credential delivery after approval
- `resources/views/admin/settings.blade.php`
  - Added password change form and success/error messages
- `resources/views/components/password-reminder.blade.php`
  - New component for password change reminders

### Routes
- `routes/web.php`
  - Added password update route: `POST /dashboard/update-password`

### Database
- `database/migrations/2025_01_21_000000_add_password_changed_to_users_table.php`
  - New migration to add `password_changed` field

### Providers
- `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`
  - Added password reminder logic to view composer

## Security Features

1. **Temporary Password Generation**: Uses `Str::random(10)` for secure random passwords
2. **Password Change Tracking**: Monitors if users have changed their temporary password
3. **Prominent Reminders**: Password reminder banner appears on all dashboard pages
4. **Validation**: Password change requires current password verification
5. **Minimum Length**: New passwords must be at least 8 characters

## User Experience

### For New Users
1. Register account → Wait for approval
2. Receive approval email with credentials
3. Login with temporary password
4. See password change reminder on dashboard
5. Change password through settings
6. Reminder disappears, account fully activated

### For Administrators
1. See pending user registrations
2. Approve users → System automatically generates credentials
3. Users receive emails with login information
4. System tracks password change status

## Email Templates

### Registration Email
- Confirms successful registration
- Explains approval process
- Sets expectations for credential delivery

### Approval Email
- Confirms account approval
- Provides login credentials
- Emphasizes security importance
- Clear instructions for next steps

## Implementation Notes

### Migration Required
Run this migration on your server:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### Environment Variables
Ensure your mail system is configured:
- `MAIL_MAILER=resend` (or your preferred mail driver)
- Proper mail service credentials

### Testing
1. Register a new user account
2. Approve the account as administrator
3. Check email delivery
4. Login with temporary credentials
5. Verify password change functionality
6. Confirm reminder banner behavior

## Benefits

1. **Improved Security**: Users can't access system until approved
2. **Automatic Credential Delivery**: No manual password sharing
3. **Password Change Enforcement**: Ensures users set secure passwords
4. **Professional Communication**: Clear email templates guide users
5. **Audit Trail**: Track password change compliance
6. **User-Friendly**: Clear reminders and instructions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Password Expiry**: Force password changes after certain time
2. **Password Strength Requirements**: Enforce stronger password policies
3. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Add 2FA for additional security
4. **Login Attempts Tracking**: Monitor failed login attempts
5. **Account Lockout**: Temporary lockout after multiple failed attempts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Emails not sending**: Check mail configuration and credentials
2. **Password reminder not showing**: Verify `password_changed` field exists
3. **Migration errors**: Ensure database connection and permissions
4. **Component not loading**: Check file paths and includes

### Debug Steps
1. Check Laravel logs for errors
2. Verify database schema
3. Test email functionality
4. Check view composer logic
5. Verify route definitions
